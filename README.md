# shrinkpdf

`shrinkpdf` is a simple Bash script which attempts to reduce the size of a PDF file
by calling GhostScript with some parameters that would otherwise be hard to memorize.

Usage:	`shrinkpdf input.pdf output.pdf`

where `input.pdf` is the path to an input PDF (or PostScript) file and `output.pdf` is 
the desired output PDF.

Given the above arguments, `shrinkpdf` will attempt to use GhostScript (`gs`) to reduce 
the size of the input file **without compromising its quality**.
This is accomplished by the following means:

* lossless compression of images in the input file,
* de-duplicating embedded fonts and images,
* introducing a more efficient internal organization of the PDF.

However, if the input PDF file is already highly compressed or very efficiently structured,
then `shrinkpdf` may not be able to further reduce its file size.
In such case, `shrinkpdf` will print a suitable message to stdout. 

In any case, the input file is not modified; only `output.pdf` is ever written to.
